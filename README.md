This program tests the long-standing hypothesis that there is a literary dependence amongst the Synoptic Gospels. It uses digital methods now readily available in humanities research such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Cosine Similarity.  A topic structure was created for the New Testament. The study compared the similarity in the mix of topics covered between pairs of books. With literary dependence, the Synoptic Gospels would have higher shared content. The expectation is that the mix of topics in the Synoptic Gospels have a higher similarity with each other, for example topics in Matthew and in Luke, than other pairings of New Testament books, because of shared content.  This was not the case. The findings from this investigation do not support literary dependence.
